# Surgical Management of Rib Fractures

Rib fractures are present in 10% of all trauma patients and about 30% of patients with significant 
chest trauma.  The presence of intrathoracic injury correlates directly with the number of fractured
 ribs.  Fracture of multiple ribs in more than one location can lead to flail chest (or open chest 
 wound) significantly comRpromising respiratory function.  The main goals in the treatment of
 multiple rib fractures are control of pain, support of respiratory function, and stabilization of 
 the chest wall either through mechanical ventilation or surgical fracture fixation.
 
**ICU Admission:** Because an increasing number of rib fractures are clearly associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality, the presence of three or more rib fractures mandates the need for 
hospitalization.  The presence of six or more rib fractures is associated with significant increases
 in mortality, usually due to associated injuries and is an indication for ICU admission.  In 
 addition, elderly patients (age >65 years) are at increased risk of complications associated with 
 rib fracture, and thus ICU admission should be considered for any elderly patient. 

**Pain Management:** Adequate pain management is fundamental to improve patient tolerance for deep 
breathing and coughing, which improves lung volume and clears secretions, thereby decreasing the 
risk for pneumonia. Pain control can be achieved with a combination of regional anesthesia, 
intravenous and oral narcotics, and intravenous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For patients 
who do not have any contraindications, placement of a thoracic epidural catheter for the 
administration of epidural analgesic agents should be strongly considered.  Patients who cannot have
 an epidural should be managed with parenteral opioid agents administered intravenously or via 
 patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and supplemented with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
 For patients failing to achieve adequate pain control with intravenous or oral opioid agents, local
  anesthetic block is a useful option. 

**Pulmonary Toilet:** The alteration in pulmonary mechanics associated with multiple rib fractures 
increases the work of breathing, placing the patient at risk for respiratory failure. Aggressive 
pulmonary toilet is important for volume expansion and managing secretions. Any patient who does not
 require immediate intubation needs to be monitored closely. Intubation may be unavoidable and, when 
 needed, should be performed preemptively under controlled conditions.  Incentive spirometry should 
 be performed at admission and documented.  Daily documentation of IS progress should be charted but
  IS should be performed hourly as part of the pulmonary toilet regimen.

**Surgical Fixation:**  Surgical fracture stabilization may be necessary under select circumstances, which
 include the presence of a flail segment in a patient who fails to wean from mechanical ventilation; 
 painful, movable ribs refractory to pain management strategies; significant chest wall deformity; 
 presence of a tissue defect; chest wall instability due to nonunion of rib fractures; or displaced 
 ribs found at the time of a thoracotomy performed for other reasons.
