# Management of the Open Abdomen

The term "open abdomen" refers to a defect in the abdominal wall that exposes the abdominal viscera. Open abdomen is often created intentionally by leaving an abdominal incision open at the completion of surgery or by opening (or re-opening) the abdomen because of abdominal compartment syndrome.

Open abdomen leads to fluid and protein losses. With prolonged open abdomen, bowel fistulization and loss of abdominal domain can complicate management. The main goal of temporary abdominal closure techniques is to control fluid losses and minimize the loss of domain.

Several techniques for temporary abdominal closure are available, including patch closure, negative pressure systems (towel- and sponge-based), and silo closure. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages with respect to their ability to control fluid loss, frequency of dressing changes, minimizing loss of domain, ease of use, and cost.
- A negative pressure system (sponge or towel based) is commonly used to control and quantify fluid loss (Grade 2C). Negative pressure systems can be used alone, or in conjunction with other temporary abdominal closure techniques. Although the applied negative pressure counteracts some of the lateral forces responsible for loss of abdominal domain, additional adjunctive techniques may be needed to help bring the fascial edges to the midline to improve the rates of primary closure.
- The Wittmann Patch has a high rate of primary fascial closure compared with other techniques in observational studies. However, this temporary closure technique, when used alone, does not adequately manage fluid loss.

Following temporary abdominal closure, the patient is monitored in the intensive care unit. Abdominal dressings associated with the closure (adhesive dressings, gauze, negative pressure systems) are changed, as needed, and the abdominal contents inspected every two to three days in the intensive care unit or operating room depending upon the condition of the patient and indication for the open abdomen. Dressings and abdominal inspections are continued until abdominal closure is feasible and safe.

Once the indication for the open abdomen has resolved, the abdomen is closed, preferably with a primary fascial closure. If primary fascial closure cannot be achieved, functional closure can be performed using a biologic mesh in-lay technique, which generates new fascial tissue between the native fascial edges. The risk of subsequent hernia with this technique is high. If the gap between the fascial edges is too wide for a functional closure, primary skin closure can be performed, or skin grafts placed to cover the fascial defect once a layer of granulation tissue has developed over the consolidated visceral mass.
