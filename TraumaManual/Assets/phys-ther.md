## Goals of Physical Therapy

1. **Intensive physiotherapy** resulted in improved mobility in trauma patients
    - No differences in discharge destination or length of stay
2. **Early mobilization** of critically ill patients is safe and feasible
    - Resulted in decreased pneumonia, DVTs, and airway, vascular, and pulmonary complications
3. **Indicators for Physical Therapy:**
    - Lower extremity fractures or weight bearing restrictions
    - Chest wall trauma
    - Recent falls or fall risk patient
    - Spine injuries
    - Traumatic Brain Injuries
    - Syncope
    - Unsteady gait w/ ambulation
    - Provider discretion
4. **Consider early consult** of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
5. **Encourage ambulation and out of bed** with nursing, in addition to therapies
