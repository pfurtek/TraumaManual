**Time:**     0630 (weekends 0700)

**Location:** B206

**Purpose:**  Provide detailed sign out of all patients evaluated by the night float team — Trauma, Emergency General Surgery, Surgical Critical Care

### Presentation Guideline:

Morning report will be delivered by the mid-level resident (PGY 2 or 3 or ACNP on Wednesday morning) and will include pertinent history and physical examination findings, results of diagnostic tests, past or pending operative procedures and on-going management plans.  Attending surgeons will lead the discussion of academic or clinical points of learning.  The senior surgery resident will be responsible for displaying laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging relative to the patient.  The discussion will close with patient location.	

Slang should be avoided when discussing patients.
