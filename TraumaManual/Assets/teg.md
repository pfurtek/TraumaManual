## Thromboelastrography (TEG)

The TEGÂ® hemostasis system monitors hemostasis using whole blood and is able to measure the balance of the hemostatic components through all phases, from clot initiation through clot lysis. Because it uses whole blood, it demonstrates the net effect of all the hemostatic components including coagulation factors, platelets, and other cellular elements. 

*TEG with platelet mapping should be ordered for all Level 1 trauma activations

**Patients being admitted to the trauma intensive care unit should receive TEG studies every 12 hours for 48 hours (4)

Rationale:  Routine coagulation test are incomplete and sometimes inaccurate because they are based on the cascade model of coagulation and use static endpoints that ignore altered thrombin generation, cellular elements and overall clot structure
