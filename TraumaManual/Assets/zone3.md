# Zone III Neck

The most cephalad anatomic zone, lies between the horizontal plane passing through the angle of the mandible and the skull base. Anatomic structures within Zone 3 include the:
- Extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries
- Jugular veins
- Spinal cord
- Cranial nerves IXâ€“XII
- Sympathetic trunk

Zone III represents a difficult anatomic zone of injury for distal vascular control. At times, subluxation, dislocation, or resection of the mandible may be necessary to gain operative vascular control. Due to the high degree of difficulty in gaining surgical access, endovascular techniques have become more and more essential to the management of these injuries.

In hemodynamically unstable patients, direct pressure or a foley catheter can be used for hemorrhage control. In extreme cases, the internal carotid artery may be ligated but significant morbidity may result.

Hemodynamically stable Zone III patients with suspicion for injury should undergo CTA of the neck and head to evaluate for vascular and aerodigestive injuries. In those stable patients with radiographic evidence of Zone III arterial injury, further diagnostic or therapeutic intervention is often required. Inaccessible arterial injuries may be addressed with embolization when a vessel can be sacrificed or with covered stenting when patency is required. Penetrating vertebral artery injuries are relatively rare but can be challenging. Recent literature demonstrates that the majority of penetrating vertebral arterial injures can be successfully managed via an endovascular approach.

Zone III aerodigestive or pharyngeal injuries also require early diagnosis and management. Pharyngeal penetrating injury carries similar risks of delayed sepsis, descending retropharyngitis, and resultant mediastinitis as esophageal injury does. It has been demonstrated that contrast swallow studies are less sensitive in detecting hypopharyngeal injuries as compared with esophageal injury. Because of this, flexible nasoendoscopy or video endoscopy should be part of the evaluation for these types of injuries.
