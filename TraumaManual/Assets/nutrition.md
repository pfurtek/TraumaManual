## Nutrition in the Trauma/EGS Patient: High Yield Pearls

- Have a nutrition plan for your patient everyday, even if the plan is NPO.  Read and follow the daily recommendations made by the dietitian in the patient’s chart. 
- At every operation, ask yourself, “Does this patient need durable enteral access?”
- Albumin and pre-albumin should not be used in isolation to assess nutritional status in the diseased or injured patient; these are markers of inflammation. 
- Malnourishment falls on a continuum: 
    - Classified as:
         - Starvation Related (pure chronic starvation, anorexia, etc)
         - Chronic Disease Related (organ failure, pancreatic cancer, RA, etc)
         - Acute Disease/Injury Related (trauma, burns, major infection, etc)
    - Screening Questions: (per history and physical exam)
         - Has there been a decrease in food intake?
         - Has there been an unintentional weight loss (>10% body weight/6 mo)?
         - Is there a decrease in hand grip strength, functional status?
         - Is there a decrease in subcutaneous fat or do you notice muscle wasting?
         - If 1 or more of above positive, patient should have an evaluation by a dietitian for specific nutrition recommendations.
         - Be aware of the risk of refeeding syndrome, of which hypophosphatemia is the hallmark.
- Consider use of a tool such as NUTRIC (for critically ill; calculators available online) or MNA (inpatient OR outpatient use; MNA available as an App); refer to dietitian as indicated by score

- Goal: start tube feeds within 24 hours of admission.
- It is safe to allow patients on <i>stable, low dose</i> vasopressor agents to receive EN.
- It is safe to allow patients with an <i>open abdomen </i>to receive EN, as long as they are not in the active resuscitation phase and the GI tract is in continuity.
- Small bowel feedings are preferred over gastric feedings, but do not wait for small bowel enteral access. Most patients tolerate gastric feeds well. If gastric feeds are not tolerated (nausea, emesis, hi residuals), small bowel access should be tried prior to the initiation of PN. 
- Volitional PO > enteral nutrition (EN) > parenteral nutrition (PN) > NPO/no nutrition.
- It is <i>not</i> necessary to await bowel sounds, flatus or a bowel movement prior to allowing PO intake. If the patient is hungry, it is safe to allow PO intake. It is <i>not </i>necessary to start with clear liquids and advance to solids.  Encourage the patient to start with small volumes of bland foods.
- If a patient has been NPO for >7 days, it is recommended that they receive PN. If the expected duration of PN will be <7 days, risk outweighs benefit.  (Pre-hospital days of NPO/poor PO count in this 7 day period!) Additionally, if the patient is malnourished upon admission, but has not been NPO x 7 days, they may still benefit from PN if it is not expected they will consistently receive > 60% of their daily calories via PO/EN. 
- In cases of mild pancreatitis, it is safe to allow patients PO intake if they are hungry. It is <i>not</i> a requirement that they be pain free and have complete resolution of enzymes. They should, however, be monitored for tolerance: increasing pain, nausea, emesis, bloating, and diarrhea may prompt return to NPO status.
- In the absence of nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, distention or radiographic evidence of ileus/obstruction, routine monitoring of gastric residual volume (GRV) is <i>not</i> required and withholding enteral nutrition for GRV < 500ml is <i>not</i> recommend. However, clinical judgement is required.
- Special cases:  <i>All patients who fall into these categories should be assessed by the dietitian.</i>
    - Obesity: 
        - May have “sarcopenic obesity” (loss of muscle mass)
        - May require high protein/low calorie diet
    - Post-Bariatric Surgery:
        - Depending on the type of surgery, patients are at risk for deficiencies of: 
        - Ca, B vitamins, ADEK, iron, zinc, copper, selenium and other micronutrients
    - Renal Failure:
        - Acutely ill ESRD patients may have higher protein need

- Nutritional Monitoring
    - There are no definitive studies to support the use of specific laboratory tests to monitor nutrition status in the critically ill patient. 
    - There are studies to support the utility of checking serum albumin as a prognostic indicator in the minimally physiologically stressed, ambulatory patient prior to elective surgery. It may be reasonable to delay elective surgery under the following circumstances: 
        - Weight loss > 10-15% body weight/6 mo.
        - Serum albumin < 3
        - BMI <18.5
    - In the critically ill patient, the best evaluation of the success of nutrition therapy is a comprehensive review of the patient’s clinical status, with particular attention paid to the following: 
        - Ability to wean from the ventilator
        - Wound healing
        - Balanced electrolytes
        - Functional improvement
    - Laboratory monitoring: 
        - WHO: All ICU patients who meet the following criteria: 
            - Patients dependent on EN for primary source of nutrition
            - Patients on total PN
            - Patients with fasciotomies, open abdomen, or enteric fistula
        - WHAT/WHEN: 
            - DAILY:
                - Basic metabolic panel
                - Magnesium, phosphorus, calcium
            - WEEKLY: 
                - Complete metabolic panel with amylase and lipase
                - 24-hour urine urea nitrogen (UUN) to begin 0600 Monday and end 0600 Tuesday
