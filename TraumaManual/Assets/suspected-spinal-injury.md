# Suspected Spinal Cord Injury

If serious neurologic deficit with spinal cord distribution is suspected obtain an immediate neurosurgical consultation.  However, general guidelines include:

- Detailed neurological exam with notation and grading of deficits
- ICU admission for hourly neurological assessment until stabilized
- Continuous maintenance of spinal alignment with log-roll precautions
- Maintain normotension and avoid hypotension
    - Intensive monitoring of vital signs
    - Placement of an arterial Line
- Mean arterial blood pressure goals may be determined by the neurosurgical consultant
  - Prevention of systemic hypotension in the acute injury phase may protect against cord ischemia and secondary parenchymal damage.
  - Spinal cord perfusion pressure is a function of mean arterial pressure and intrathecal pressure.  An increase in ITP or decrease in MAP or a combination of the two can result in compromised SCPP.
  - SCPP = MAP – ITP
  - Example: MAP goal of 85 mm Hg – 90 mm Hg for 6 days to get a patient through the window of maximal swelling (post injury day 3-5) and attenuate further disability in severe spinal cord injuries.

## Shock associated with cervical spinal cord injuries
-   C1-C5 -> 31% incidence of hypotension and bradycardia
-   C6-C7 -> 24% incidence

## Types of Neurogenic Shock
-   Vasodilatory neurogenic shock
    -   Dry, warm skin
    -   Bradycardia, hypotension
    -   Decreased CVP, SV and CO
    -   Rx: treat with phenylephrine or other pressors

-   Cardiogenic neurogenic shock
    -   Dry or wet, cold skin
    -   Tachycardia (rarely bradycardia), hypotension
    -   Normal or increased CVP, decreased SV and CO
    -   Rx: consider inotropic support
-   Neuroendocrine Neurogenic shock
    -   Hypotension not responsive to vasopressors
    -   Normal or increased CVP, decreased SV and CO
    -   Rx:  resolution with hydrocortisone clinically confirms
