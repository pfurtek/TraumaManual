## Pelvic Fractures and Hemorrhage

There is a myriad of ways to handle pelvic fractures. The key is to identify those fractures and patient conditions that necessitate everything from external fracture stabilization to angiographic embolization.

Patients with unstable fractures (see below) and hypotension should have external stabilization to reduce pain and bleeding

- Pelvic binder
- Sheet binder
- External fixator

#### Examination Notes:
- Gross blood at urethral meatus or foley resistance -> perform urethrogram
- Rectal exam - high-riding prostate? rectal tear?
- Vaginal exam - if high suspicion for tear

FAST exam and DPA do NOT rule out retroperitoneal pelvic hemorrhage

80% of pelvic fracture-associated hemorrhage is venous.

#### Pelvis x-ray

- Obtain in all hemodynamically unstable patients undergoing resuscitation
- If concern exists about the presence of a pelvic fracture, a pelvic Xray must be obtained in the room

### Fracture Types

#### Type A: Stable
- Isolated rami fractures
- Iliac wing fractures
- Pubic symphysis diastasis less than 2.5 cm

**Type B: Partially unstable** (rotationally unstable, vertically stable)

- **B1**:  Lateral Compression, intrinsically stable fracture of ring. 
    - Less common
    - Look for: 
	    - Bladder perforation
	    - Lower urogenital tract and rectum injury
	    - Abdominal injury – e.g. bowel perforation
- **B2**: Horizontal compression, Anterior (pubic symphasis and/or superior and inferior rami) combined with posterior disruption (SI joint) 
    - "Open book" fracture
    - Look for:
  	   - Pubic symphasis widening > 2.5 cm
  	   - Bladder perforation
  	   - Lower urogenital tract and rectum injury
  	   - Abdominal injury – e.g. bowel perforation
  	    
**Type C: Unstable** (rotationally and vertically), often with severe bleeding.

- Disruption of the sacroiliac joint due to vertical shear forces
- C1: Unilateral.
- C2: Bilateral.
- C3: Involving acetabulum.
- Look for: 
    - Bladder perforation
    - Lower urogenital tract and rectum injury
    - Major nerve, artery, vein injury
    - Abdominal injury – e.g. bowel perforation
    - Diaphragm injury

### Early Angiography and Embolization

Major Indications:  

- Pelvic fracture and hemodynamic instability (no other source of bleeding)
- CT with active pelvic contrast extravasation

Minor Indications:

- Pubic symphysis diastasic > 2.5-3 cm
- SI joint disruption

### OR considerations

- Pelvic or pre-peritoneal packing may be helpful in hemodynamic instability
- Some rectal injuries or perineal wounds may require fecal diversion (colostomy)
- Pelvic fractures should be repaired after the patient is fully resuscitated
