# Management of Blunt Cerebrovascular Injuries (BCVI)

Blunt injury to the carotid or vertebral arteries occurs in 1-2% of trauma patients. 
The clinical impact is disproportionately high, with the incidence of subsequent cerebrovascular 
accident as high as 25% in some series.  The resulting mortality ranges from 9-13% if untreated.  
Prompt diagnosis and treatment is therefore imperative.  A literature search will reveal a wealth 
of information on this injury subset.  Some pertinent articles are listed below :

## Findings that warrant evaluation for BCVI include :
   
- Unexplained neurologic deficits (inconsistent with CT findings)
    - including GCS < 8 with normal head CT
- Horner’s syndrome
- LeFort II or III fractures (unilateral or bilateral)
- Cervical spine injuries, including transverse process fractures of C1-C6
- Neck soft tissue injuries, including seatbelt signs
- Skull base fractures

Identification of an injury to either the vertebral or carotid artery warrants 
consultation with neurosurgery. Though the consulting neurosurgeon will make the 
determination of the appropriate therapy for the injury, the following management 
pathways may be expected.


## Mild to Moderate Injury or the Presence of Pseudoaneurysm (Asymptomatic)

* Initial therapy with ASA 325mg po
* MRA with gadolinium 3 months following injury
	-resolved : ASA is discontinued
	-persistent : continue ASA 325mg for one year, then decrease to 81mg
	-progression : add Plavix and repeat MRA at 6 months following injury

## Severe Injury or Complete Occlusion (Asymptomatic)

* Anticoagulation for 6 months with goal INR 2.0-3.0
	-If anticoagulation is contraindicated, ASA 81mg with a transition to full-dose
	 ASA + Plavix when allowed
* MRA with gadolinium 6 months following injury for repeat evaluation

## Endoluminal Thrombus (Asymptomatic)

* Anticoagulation for 3 months with goal INR 2.0-3.0
* MRA with gadolinium at 3 months from injury
	- Resolved : continue ASA 325mg + Plavix for one year
	- Persistent : continued anticoagulation

## Symptomatic BCVI Injuries

### TIA’s and Mild Strokes
   * If in a watershed distribution, plan full anticoagulation with goal INR 2.0-3.0
   * If the distribution is non-watershed, treat with ASA 325mg + Plavix

### Severe Stroke
   * Treat with ASA 325mg + Plavix

All symptomatic BCVI’s should undergo repeat imaging using MRA with gadolinium 6 months after injury.
