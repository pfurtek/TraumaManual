# Caring for Patients after Acute Spinal Cord Injury
	
Admit to Intensive Care Unit

Early Surgical Stabilization

***NO STEROIDS***

## AUTONOMIC INSTABILITY
- Heart Rate- bradycardia easily occurs with certain stimulation due to unopposed vagal stimulation.  Tx with Atropine if sustained
- Blood Pressure- loss of vasomotor tone often results in vasodilation and hypotension.   Tx Levophed;  maintain MAPS >85 for 6 days and midodrine 10 mg PO Q 8 hours for chronic issues
- Temperature- loss of intrinsic temperature control.  Monitor temp and regulate artificially

## RESPIRATORY:

- INJURY LEVELS
1. C1-C4:  paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles; will need intubation and likely tracheostomy for long-term ventilator dependence ( Early tracheostomy if suspect MV will be > 5 days)
2. C5-T6 paralysis of intercostals, but diaphragm is intact- may need acute support
3. T6-T12 abdominal muscles paralyzed, may have some decreased function
<br>
- GUIDELINES
    - Intubate early of needed plan for early tracheostomy if unable liberate from ventilator in the first week
    - Maintain strict VAP prevention strategies
    - Head of bed up or reverse Trendelenburg
    - Avoid abdominal distention
    - TREATMENT:
        - Incentive spirometry 10 times per hour while awake
        - EZPAP Q4 hours
        - BiPAP at night
        - CPT vest Q 4 hours
        - Quad cough Q 4 hours

## SKIN

- Baseline skin assesement
- Pressure injury prevention plan
- Pressure Mattress (not air if unstable)
- Reposition every 2 hours from admission to discharge
- Consult wound nurse at first sign of injury
- Daily baths and keep patient and bed dry
- Remove collar and check skin under collar daily
- Up in chair TID starting POD #1 with waffle cushion
- Proshield or Sensicare apply to buttocks topically BID and PRN stool

## BLADDER

Several changes that can occur including: contractile bladder, flaccid bladder, or combined.

- Indwelling catheter initially
- Intermittent catheterization after stabilization and UOP <2 liters a day
- Oxybutin for bladder spasms
- Keep hydrated to prevent renal stones
- Latex free gloves to prevent allergy
- Recurrent UTI
- Renal and bladder calculi
- Vesico ureteric reflux

## Complications

- Recurrent UTI
- Renal and bladder calculi
- Vesico ureteric reflux
- Latex allergy development due to increased latex exposure: use latex free catheters

## BOWEL

Dysfunction occurs as a result of loss of neurological control and iatrogenic causes.

1. Some patients may have a ‘reflex’ bowel. Although peristalsis will move stool through bowel, the anal sphincter may not relax. It may need stimulation to relax & allow passage of stool.
2. Some patients may have a ‘flaccid’ bowel. Reflexes that move stool through the bowel are impaired and the anal sphincter is relaxed preventing stool being held in the rectum.
3. Some patients have a combination of bowel function problems.
    1.  Constipation-Caused by insufficient fluid & fiber intake, insufficient aperients, ineffective evacuation of stool, medications (anticholenergics, opioids),and immobility. **Treatment:** increase fluids and fiber/ increase regimen.
        - Bisacodyl suppository 1 PR at bedtime with digital stimulation
        - Bisacodyl suppository 1 PR daily prn constipation
        - Docusate 50 mg and Sennosides 8.6 mg 2 Tabs PO BID.

    2.  Impaction: Caused by: chronic constipation; will often have liquid overflow. 
    3.  Diarrhea: Change in diet, antibiotics, bacteria, excess aperients, high impaction. **Treatment:** adjust diet, reduce aperients, stool specimen, abdominal x-ray if impaction suspected; possibly consider probiotics

## NUTRITION

- Start feeding within first 24 hours of admission.  NGT or gastric tube if NPO is to be prolonged.    Ensure adequate calories up to 140% of baseline requirements

## VTE

- Start Chemoprophylaxis as soon as possible

## JOINT CONTRACTURESA

- Physiotherapy for joint range of motion and alignment
- Ankle splints
- Wrist splints and occupational therapy
- Make referrals to occupational and physical therapy within 72 hours of admission

## PSYCHOSOCIAL

- Involve social work and counselors as early as possible
- Consult Physical Medicine and rehabilitation as soon as possible
