# Tertiary Trauma Survey

The purpose of the tertiary survey is to improve the care of injured patients by reducing missed injuries and long delays in diagnosis.  A tertiary survey consists of a re-examination of the injured patient with a complete physical exam, as well as review of all studies.  Appropriate timing of the survey is documented elsewhere in this manual.  A tertiary survey may be performed by any member of the trauma team including attending surgeons, residents and advanced care nurse practitioners.  Medical students may participate in the tertiary survey under the supervision of another trauma team member.  All findings must be documented in the patientâ€™s medical record.

An important aspect of the tertiary exam is review of consultant recommendations as well.  This facilitates acquisition of further diagnostic studies and operative and/or discharge planning.  Further, a review of the operations and procedures that have already been performed to date must be documented in the medical record, as well as any pending operations or procedures.  Finally, the diagnosis and problem list should be updated in the medical record. Specifically identify in the medical record any new findings that resulted from the tertiary survey.
