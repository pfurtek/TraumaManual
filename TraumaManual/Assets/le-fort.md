# Le Fort Fractures

- Le fort showed that the pattern of facial fractures cannot be predicted based on the overlying soft tissue injuries. There are three common sites for horizontal fractures of maxilla.

## Le Fort Fracture Definitions

### I - Horizontal fracture of maxilla
- Separates the hard palate from remainder of maxilla
- Through the lower 1/3 of nasal septum
- "Open" fracture by definition - involves maxillary sinus
- No hypoesthesia - below infra-orbital nerve

### II - Pryamidal Fracture
- Starts at nasal bone, through lacrimal, through zygomaticomaxillary suture
- Posteriorly through the upper pterygoid plate
- "Open" fracture by definition - Involves maxillary sinus
- +/- hypoesthesia - infra-orbital nerve (lateral nose, cheek, upper lip)

### III - Craniofacial disjunction
- Unstable - separate facial bones from cranium
- Le Fort II patern of fractures
- Posteriorly through ethmoid, laterally through orbits
- "Open" fracture by definition - involves maxillary sinus

#### If Le Fort fractures suspected
 - Perform detailed Head + Neck exam including cranial nerve exam
 - Assess the maxillary bone by stabilizing the head and nasal root with one hand and pushing/pulling upper alveolar ridge with the other
 - Order CT Maxillary/Face
 - Consult Facial Trauma Service if fracture identified

 ##### Skull base
 - consists of ethmoid, frontal, sphenoid, temporal, and occipital bones
    - process


### <u>Management of antibioltics in facial fractures: </u>

1. CSF Leak:
- No benefit from prophylactic antibiotics
2. Pneumocephaly:
- Inadequate data to support use of prophylactic antibiotics
3. Open Facial Fractures:
- Utility of prophylactic antibiotics is uncertain
- Orbital fractures that involve a sinus should receive antibiotic prophylaxis.
- Maxillary fractures that extend through the tooth-bearing region or through the nasal or sinus mucosa warrant prophylactic antibiotics.
- Nasal fractures with open wounds require antibiotics.
- Mandibular fractures require antibiotics if they involve tooth bearing region or if open.
- PCN or clindamycin are acceptable
- Duration recommended is 7 days
