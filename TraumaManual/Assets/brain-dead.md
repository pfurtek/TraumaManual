## Determination of Brain Death

The clinical neurologic examination remains standard and is based off of the 2010 Evidenced Based Guidelines for Determining Brain Death in Adults by the American Academy of Neurology (3).  This is adapted from the “IU Determination of Death in Adult Patients by Neurologic Criteria” policy (MS 3.46).

- Death by neurologic criteria shall be determined in accordance with accepted medical standards, as outlined by the American Academy of Neurology and described here. Deficiencies in the evidence base for determining death by neurologic criteria require that clinicians exercise considerable judgment when applying the criteria in specific circumstances.
- Under the direct supervision of an attending physician, students and trainees may participate in the testing and clinical exam performed as part of determining death by neurologic criteria.
- Only attending physician members of the IU Health Medical Staff who are experienced in determining death by neurologic criteria and who practice in the areas of critical care, emergency medicine, neurology and neurosurgery may declare a patient dead using these criteria.
- In order to avoid potential or apparent conflict, physicians from the Transplant Service may not be involved in the determination of death by neurologic criteria. 
- All patients suspected to be brain dead or at risk of imminent brain death shall be referred to IOPO for assessment of the patient's medical suitability as a potential organ donor, per IU Health PC RHC 1.01 Organ and Tissue Donation.
- The time of the patient's death is the time when death by neurologic criteria has been established by clinical exam, or exceptional circumstances as described in Procedure B 5 and an attending physician declares the patient brain dead. The clinical exam and all relevant test results must be documented in the patient's medical record at that time.

#### Determination of Brain Death: Procedure

- Clinical Evaluation Prerequisites*

    - Establish that coma is with an identified cause.
    - Exclude major confounding factors
        - No reversible medical illnesses (Acid-base, severe electrolyte changes)
        - No evidence of “locked-in” syndrome
        - No evidence of drug intoxication or poisoning
        - No neuromuscular blocking medications 
    - Achieve a normal core temperature (>36 ° C)
        - Brain stem reflexes disappear when core temperature drops below 28 ° C
    - Achieve normal systolic blood pressure; vasopressors can be used to assist.

- Neurologic Evaluation: 

    - No motor response to noxious stimuli (pain) on the face or limbs.
        - Any movement produced by noxious stimuli should be able to be attributed to spinal cord reflexes
    - Absence of brain-stem reflexes

- Prerequisites are not required when subjects ICP=MAP. The clinical exam can be carried out regardless of abnormalities

- Confirmatory Testing

    - Apnea test: Absence of breathing in the setting of normotension, normothermia, euvolemia and baseline eucapnea in the absence of hypoxia.
        - Adjust vasopressors to a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg. "Preoxygenate for at least 10 minutes with 100% oxygen.
        - Adjust ventilation to achieve a pH of 7 .35-7.45.
        - Reduce positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 5 cm H20 (oxygen desaturation with decreasing PEEP may suggest difficulty with apnea testing).
        - If pulse oximetry oxygen saturation remains 95%, obtain a baseline blood gas (Pa02, PaC02, pH, bicarbonate, base excess).
        - Disconnect the patient from the ventilator.
        - Preserve oxygenation (e.g., deliver 100% 02 via suction catheter at 6 L/min).
        - Look closely for respiratory movements for 8-10 minutes. Respiration is defined as abdominal or chest excursions and may include a brief gasp. If respiration is noted, the test should be aborted.
        - Test may need to be aborted if there a significant clinical decline in the patient's condition,
        - Retry procedure with T-piece, CPAP 10 cm H20, and 100% 02 12 L/min.
        - If no respiratory drive is observed, repeat blood gas (Pa02, PaC02, pH, bicarbonate, base excess) after approximately 8 minutes.
        - If respiratory movements are absent and arterial PC02 is greater than 60 mm Hg (or 20 mm Hg increase in arterial PC02 over a baseline normal arterial PC02), the apnea test result is positive (i.e., confirms the clinical diagnosis of brain death).
        - If the test is inconclusive but the patient is hemodynamically stable during the procedure, it may be repeated for a longer period of time (10-15 minutes) after the patient is again adequately preoxygenated.

- Ancillary Tests:  When uncertainty exists about the reliability of the parts of the neurologic examination or when parts of the neurologic examination cannot be performed (e.g. facial trauma).  **Ancillary tests should not be done in lieu of a rigorous neurologic examination.**

    - (Most Common) <u>Technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime  brain profusion scintigraphy</u>: (also known as an isotope flow study with brain scan) No flow to brain and no uptake of isotope in brain parenchyma (hollow skull phenomenon) is consistent with brain death.
    - <u>Conventional angiography</u>: No intracerebral filling at the level of the carotid bifurcation or circle of Willis; patent external carotid circulation, possibly delayed superior longitudinal sinus filling.
    - <u>Electroencephalography</u>: no electrical activity during at least 30 minutes of recording according to the American Electroencephalographic Society guidelines.
    - <u>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography</u>: small systolic peaks in early systole without diastolic flow or reverberating flow - indicating very high vascular resistance associated with greatly increased intracranial pressure.
